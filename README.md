# E-Commerce Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a **React-based e-commerce web application** that enables users to browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The project follows modern React development patterns and best practices, with **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Redux Toolkit** (Global State Management)
- **React Redux** (Version: 8.1.2) - Integration of Redux with React
- **React Router** (Client-side Routing)
- **LocalStorage** (Persistent Cart Data)
- **Fetch API** (Data Fetching)
- **Stripe** (Payment Processing)
- **Cloudinary** (Image Hosting)
- **clsx** (Conditional Class Names Handling)


## Key Concepts and Design Patterns

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
The project is built using modular, reusable components, which improves maintainability and scalability. Some key components include:
- **Navbar**: Navigation bar with links and cart count
- **Product**: Displays individual product details
- **ProductDetails**: Fetches and displays details for a single product
- **Cart**: Manages items added by the user

### 2. Redux Toolkit for State Management
State management is handled using Redux Toolkit, centralizing cart logic in a Redux slice. This provides efficient state updates and improves scalability.  
The project uses **React Redux (v8.1.2)** for integrating Redux with React components.

#### Example Redux Slice:
const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name: "cart",
    initialState: { cart: [] },
    reducers: {
        addProduct: (state, action) => {
            const existingProduct = state.cart.find(product => product.id === action.payload.id);
            if (existingProduct) {
                existingProduct.quantity++;
            } else {
                state.cart.push({ ...action.payload, quantity: 1 });
            }
        },
        removeProduct: (state, action) => {
            state.cart = state.cart.filter(product => product.id !== action.payload.id);
        },
    },
});
####  React Router for Navigation
The application uses React Router for client-side routing. This enables seamless navigation between different pages like:

/ (Home Page)
/about (About Us Page)
/products (Product Listing Page)
/products/:id (Product Details Page)
/cart (Shopping Cart)
####  Global State Integration with Redux
## The store.js file configures Redux with the cartSlice, making it accessible throughout the app.

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { cartSlice } from "../features/cartSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: cartSlice.reducer,
});

#### The Provider from React Redux wraps the entire application, ensuring that Redux state is available globally.
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store/store.js";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Navbar />
        <div className="container">
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
            <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
            <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />
            <Route path="/products/:id" element={<ProductDetails />}>
              <Route path="" element={<ProductDetailInfo />} />
              <Route path="nutrition" element={<ProductDetailNutrition />} />
              <Route path="storage" element={<ProductDetailStorage />} />
            </Route>
            <Route path="/cart" element={<Cart />} />
          </Routes>
        </div>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </Provider>
  );
}
####  Cart Management with Redux Selectors
## Selectors improve performance by computing derived data efficiently.

const cartCountSelector = (state) => {
    return state.cart.reduce((total, product) => total + product.quantity, 0);
};

const cartValueSelector = (state) => {
    return state.cart.reduce(
        (total, product) => total + product.price * product.quantity, 0
    );
};
#### Product Component with Redux Actions
## Products can be added and removed from the cart using Redux actions.

const onProductAdd = () => {
  dispatch(addProduct(details));
};
const onProductDelete = () => {
  dispatch(removeProduct(details));
};
####  Persistent Data Storage (LocalStorage)
## The shopping cart state is persisted in LocalStorage, allowing users to retain their cart items even after refreshing the page.

useEffect(() => {
  if (cart) {
    localStorage.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart));
  }
}, [cart]);

#### Features Implemented
âœ… Dynamic Navigation Bar (Shows cart item count)
âœ… Product Listing & Details Page (Fetches product details from API)
âœ… Shopping Cart with Add/Remove Functionality (Redux)
